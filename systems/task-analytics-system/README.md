# Task Analytics System

An integrated system combining task management and analytics features to provide comprehensive project insights and productivity tracking.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Integrated Dashboard
- Combined task and analytics overview
- Real-time metrics and KPIs
- Performance insights and trends
- Visual data representation

### âœ… Task Management Integration
- Full task lifecycle management
- Progress tracking and monitoring
- Priority and status management
- Due date and overdue detection

### ðŸ“Š Analytics Integration
- Task completion analytics
- Performance metrics calculation
- Trend analysis and reporting
- Data visualization and charts

### ðŸ”„ Real-time Synchronization
- Live updates between task and analytics data
- Automatic metric recalculation
- Responsive data visualization
- Cross-feature data consistency

## Architecture

This system demonstrates the monorepo approach by:

1. **Importing UI Components**: Uses `@monorepo/ui-components` for consistent design
2. **Utilizing Utilities**: Leverages `@monorepo/utils` for data processing
3. **Composing Features**: Combines `@monorepo/feature-task-management` and `@monorepo/feature-analytics`
4. **Configuration Only**: No custom business logic - pure composition and configuration

## System Components

### IntegratedDashboard
- Combines task and analytics data
- Displays unified metrics and insights
- Provides cross-feature visualization
- Shows performance indicators

### Navigation
- Seamless navigation between features
- Consistent user experience
- Active state management
- Responsive design

## Installation & Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the system directory
cd systems/task-analytics-system

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Usage

The system runs on `http://localhost:3001` and provides three main views:

1. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`): Integrated overview with combined metrics
2. **Tasks** (`/tasks`): Full task management interface
3. **Analytics** (`/analytics`): Comprehensive analytics dashboard

## Integration Examples

### Task Data to Analytics
```typescript
// Convert task data to analytics format
const taskAnalytics = tasks.map(task => ({
  id: task.id,
  timestamp: task.createdAt,
  category: task.status,
  value: task.progress,
  metadata: {
    priority: task.priority,
    title: task.title
  }
}));
```

### Combined Metrics
```typescript
// Calculate integrated metrics
const totalTasks = tasks.length;
const completedTasks = tasks.filter(t => t.status === 'done').length;
const completionRate = percentage(completedTasks, totalTasks);
```

### Cross-Feature Visualization
```typescript
// Status distribution chart
const statusChartData = Object.entries(statusData).map(([status, count]) => ({
  label: status.replace('-', ' '),
  value: count,
  color: getStatusColor(status)
}));
```

## Key Benefits

- Future-proof design

## Development

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

## Technologies Used

- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks and concurrent features
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **React Router**: Client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling (via ui-components)

## Individual Contribution

This system represents an individual's assembly of the group-created packages into a functional application. It demonstrates:

1. **Package Integration**: Successfully combining multiple monorepo packages
2. **Configuration Skills**: Proper setup and configuration of the integrated system
3. **Architecture Understanding**: Knowledge of modular design principles
4. **Problem Solving**: Creating seamless user experiences across features

The system showcases how monorepo packages can be composed into powerful, cohesive applications while maintaining modularity and reusability.
