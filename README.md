1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd modular-genesis-system
   ```

2. **Install root dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build all packages:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:packages
   ```

4. **Run the integrated system:**

   cd systems/task-analytics-system
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

### Individual Package Development

**UI Components:**
```bash
cd packages/ui-components
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Utils:**
```bash
cd packages/utils
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Task Management:**
```bash
cd packages/feature-task-management
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Analytics:**
```bash
cd packages/feature-analytics
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Using UI Components
```typescript
import { Button, Card, DataTable } from '@monorepo/ui-components';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Card.Header>
        <Card.Title>Example</Card.Title>
      </Card.Header>
      <Card.Content>
        <Button variant="primary">Click me</Button>
      </Card.Content>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### Using Utilities
```typescript
import { formatDate, validateEmail, retry } from '@monorepo/utils';

const formattedDate = formatDate(new Date(), 'long');
const isValid = validateEmail('user@example.com');
const apiCall = await retry(() => fetch('/api/data'), 3);
```

### Using Features
```typescript
import { TaskManager } from '@monorepo/feature-task-management';
import { AnalyticsDashboard } from '@monorepo/feature-analytics';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <TaskManager />
      <AnalyticsDashboard />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### Modular Design
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each package has a single responsibility
- **Loose Coupling**: Packages can be used independently
- **High Cohesion**: Related functionality is grouped together
- **Reusability**: Components and utilities can be shared across projects

### Development Workflow
- **Component-First**: Build reusable components before features
- **Utility-Driven**: Create shared utilities for common operations
- **Feature Composition**: Combine components and utilities into features
- **System Integration**: Assemble features into complete applications

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across all packages
- **ESLint**: Consistent code style and quality
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage (recommended)
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation and examples

## 🤝 Collaboration Guidelines

### Package Development
1. **UI Components**: Focus on reusable, accessible, and well-documented components
2. **Utils**: Create pure functions with clear inputs and outputs
3. **Features**: Build complete, self-contained functionality
4. **Systems**: Compose packages into working applications

### Version Management
- Each package maintains its own version
- Semantic versioning for breaking changes
- Coordinated releases for interdependent packages

### Code Standards
- TypeScript for all packages
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Export all public APIs through index files

## 🛠️ Development Scripts

### Root Level
```bash
npm run build:packages    # Build all packages
npm run clean            # Clean all build artifacts
npm run type-check       # Run TypeScript checks
npm run lint            # Run ESLint on all packages
```

### Package Level
```bash
npm run build           # Build the package
npm run dev             # Watch mode for development
npm run type-check      # TypeScript validation
```
